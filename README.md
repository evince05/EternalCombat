_Defeat endless hordes of skeletons in this 2D Java video game!_<br>

## Overview ##
**Eternal Combat** is a 2D shoot-em-up arcade game, built entirely from scratch in Java.
In the game, you are a knight equipped with a bow, and you have to survive an endless onslaught of skeletons.

The game gets difficult as you progress; skeleton archers and knights make it that much harder to survive.
When you kill a skeleton, there's a chance you'll receive a powerup to help you in your fight.
